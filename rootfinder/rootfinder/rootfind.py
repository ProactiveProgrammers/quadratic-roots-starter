    # TODO: Use the source code example on page 21 of the
    # "Doing Math with Python" to implement this function.
    # TODO: Your function should take as input the values
    # of a, b, and c and return the values of x_one
    # and x_two as a two-tuple of values.
    # TODO: The return values of this function can either
    # be a complex number (i.e., involving an imaginary
    # number and designated with j) or a floating-point
    # value (i.e., not involving an imaginary number and
    # instead only a decimal value)
